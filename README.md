# 🔐 Phishing Website Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect phishing websites using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). Phishing websites are designed to trick users into revealing personal information such as passwords, banking details, and credit card numbers. This project helps identify such malicious websites based on extracted textual features and URL patterns.

## 🔍 Overview

Phishing websites can look identical to legitimate sites, making it difficult to detect them without automated tools. This project leverages NLP for feature extraction and machine learning models like Random Forest and SVM for classification.

The final result is a **Streamlit web application** where users can input a website URL or features and get real-time predictions.
